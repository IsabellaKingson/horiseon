## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project is a landing page for the social media management company Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc. or 'Horiseon'. My motivation for this project was to refine the starter code so that it would meet accessiblity standards and have improved search engine optimization (SEO). 

The starter code was separated into many div elements, which works visually, but is not optimal for screen readers and other accessibility tools. For this reason, I changed the code to have logical HTML semantic elements and added alt attributes to each image. I also added a title, 'Horiseon Social Services, Inc.,' to the head element to improve the site's SEO. 

Additionally, I reordered and refine the page's CSS to reduce redundancies and make the code clearer for future use and site expansion. 

Through this project I learned the importance of accessibility in web design. The web is for everyone, it is important as a web developer to make it accessible. This means adding alts where you can and making sure the HTML frame is laid out in a sequential order for accessibility tools to read with ease.
I also learned about the value of class selectors for styling in CSS. In my original edit, I removed most of the class selectors, because I had deemed them unnecessary. Upon further reflection and an explanation from a tutor, I now understand that while selecting elements can be helpful in some cases, as a webpage grows and you have more recurring elements, it can be necessary to style different occurances of the same element differently.
